1. CORS Failed to load resources
    - You need to add 'proxy' : 'http://localhost:3001' which is the backend server address to the package.json
    - Also check the address backend you've added in the frontend part. I had done localhost/3000 instead of localhost:3000 and spent
      2 weeks wondering why my code wouldn't work
    - Don't forget to do the regular app.use(cors()), and also pass the cors configuration into the server

2. Can't set property of undefined object
    - Not very common. Just used this.tail instead of list.tail in the useEffect

3. X - axis (timeMilliSeconds) only showed for the first point and was undefined later
    - It is a bug in ApexCharts. So include a key prop as well to ensure the graph always refreshes.
    - You don't have to tap into useId and stuff. You can just use JSON.stringify(series) as your series would be different when you update it.
